#### Data Description

The data that we have used, is from a study that investigates how
smoking during pregnancy influences gene expression in the placenta.
This was done by transcriptome analysis of the placenta from 76 women
who gave birth to a baby at the Children Hospital of Motol in Prague
between 17 June and 26 June 2007 (12 deliveries) and 8 October 2007 and
26 February 2008 (64 deliveries). 12 of these women smoked during their
pregnancy, where 62 did not. 2 of the mothers were eliminated from the
dataset, as there were missing values [1].
